# Uncomment these lines to use a Postgres database. Both are needed, since in production
# (which uses Linux) we want to install from source, so that security updates from the
# underlying Heroku stack image are picked up automatically, thanks to dynamic linking.
# On other platforms/in development, the precompiled binary package is used instead, to
# speed up installation and avoid errors from missing libraries/headers.
